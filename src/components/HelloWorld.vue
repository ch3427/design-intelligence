      <h2>Business Model Canvas</h2>
      <p>
        The Business Model Canvas (BMC) is a powerful strategic management tool designed to swiftly and effectively define and
        communicate a business idea or concept. It serves as a one-page document that meticulously outlines the
        fundamental elements of a business or product, structuring an idea in a coherent and accessible way.
      </p>

      <p>
        Both external and internal factors converge around the value proposition, representing the exchange of value between
        your business and your customers or clients.
      </p>

      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Why do we use the Business Model Canvas?</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Quickly depict a comprehensive picture of the business idea.</li>
        <li>Understand the business and establish connections between the idea and its transformation into a viable business.</li>
        <li>Examine customer decision-making processes that influence the use of your systems.</li>
        <li>Provide a clear, shared understanding of the business.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>How to Use It</h3>

      <h4>Value Proposition</h4>
      <p>
        The Value Proposition is foundational to any business or product, representing the fundamental concept of value exchange
        between your business and customers.
      </p>
      <p>Ask yourself:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What problem am I solving?</li>
        <li>Why would someone want this problem solved?</li>
        <li>What motivates this problem?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Tips:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Consider Maslowâ€™s Hierarchy of Needs to understand how your product/service addresses customer needs.</li>
        <li>If selling to other businesses, understand your role in fulfilling their Value Proposition.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Customer Segments</h4>
      <p>
        Customer Segmentation involves dividing the customer base into groups based on similarities such as age, gender, interests,
        and spending habits.
      </p>
      <p>Consider:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Who is the problem-solving for?</li>
        <li>What characteristics define your target customers?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Tip: Understand your market size to grasp the micro and macro perspectives of your market.</p>

      <h4>Customer Relationships</h4>
      <p>
        This aspect explores how a business interacts with its customers, whether in person, online, or through events.
      </p>
      <p>Examples:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>In-person (one-to-one)</li>
        <li>Online</li>
        <li>Events (one-to-many)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Create a User Journey Map to understand customer interactions, helping identify opportunities for automation.</p>

      <h4>Channels</h4>
      <p>Channels refer to avenues through which customers connect with your business. Consider where your customers are and how to reach them effectively.</p>
      <p>Ask:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>How do we inform our customer segment about our value proposition?</li>
        <li>Where are our customers? (social media, events, etc.)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Examples of Channels:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Social media</li>
        <li>Email marketing</li>
        <li>Networking</li>
        <li>SEO/SEM</li>
        <li>Content marketing</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Key Activities</h4>
      <p>Key Activities are the actions your business takes to achieve the value proposition for customers.</p>
      <p>Ask:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>What activities does the business undertake?</li>
        <li>What resources are used? (time, expertise, distribution, etc.)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Examples:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Consulting</li>
        <li>Designing</li>
        <li>Web development</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Key Resources</h4>
      <p>Identify the practical resources needed to undertake key business activities.</p>
      <p>Consider:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Office space</li>
        <li>Computers</li>
        <li>Staff</li>
        <li>Internet connection</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Examples:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Office space</li>
        <li>Computers</li>
        <li>Hosting</li>
        <li>People (staff)</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Key Partners</h4>
      <p>List external companies or parties necessary to achieve key activities and deliver value to customers.</p>
      <p>Ask:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Who else is needed to achieve the value proposition?</li>
        <li>Who are key partners to fulfill the business promise?</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Cost Structures</h4>
      <p>Cost Structures encompass the monetary cost of operating the business.</p>
      <p>Consider:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Costs of key activities, resources, and partnerships.</li>
        <li>Legal and insurance costs.</li>
        <li>Opportunity cost of running the business.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Revenue Streams</h4>
      <p>Revenue Streams are the ways your business converts the value proposition into financial gain.</p>
      <p>Consider:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pricing strategies aligned with solving customer problems.</li>
        <li>Various revenue models (subscription, freemium, etc.).</li>
      </ul>
