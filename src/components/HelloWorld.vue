      <h2>Business Model Canvas</h2>
      <p>
        The Business Model Canvas (BMC) is a powerful strategic management tool designed to swiftly and effectively define and
        communicate a business idea or concept. It serves as a one-page document that meticulously outlines the
        fundamental elements of a business or product, structuring an idea in a coherent and accessible way.
      </p>
      <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/800x400" alt="Business Model Canvas" />
      <p>
        Both external and internal factors converge around the value proposition, representing the exchange of value between
        your business and your customers or clients.
      </p>

      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Why do we use the Business Model Canvas?</p>
      <p>
        Quickly depict a comprehensive picture of the business idea. Understand the business and establish connections between
        the idea and its transformation into a viable business. Examine customer decision-making processes that influence the
        use of your systems. Provide a clear, shared understanding of the business.
      </p>

      <h3>How to Use It</h3>

      <h4>Value Proposition</h4>
      <p>
        The Value Proposition is foundational to any business or product, representing the fundamental concept of value exchange
        between your business and customers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ask yourself: What problem am I solving? Why would someone want this problem solved? What motivates this problem?
      </p>
      <p>
        Tips: Consider Maslowâ€™s Hierarchy of Needs to understand how your product/service addresses customer needs. If selling
        to other businesses, understand your role in fulfilling their Value Proposition.
      </p>

      <h4>Customer Segments</h4>
      <p>
        Customer Segmentation involves dividing the customer base into groups based on similarities such as age, gender,
        interests, and spending habits.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider: Who is the problem-solving for? What characteristics define your target customers?

        Create a User Journey Map to understand customer interactions, helping identify opportunities for automation.
      </p>

      <h4>Channels</h4>
      <p>
        Channels refer to avenues through which customers connect with your business. Consider where your customers are and how
        to reach them effectively.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ask: How do we inform our customer segment about our value proposition? Where are our customers? (social media, events, etc.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Examples of Channels: Social media, Email marketing, Networking, SEO/SEM, Content marketing
      </p>

        Key Activities are the actions your business takes to achieve the value proposition for customers.

      </p>

        List external companies or parties necessary to achieve key activities and deliver value to customers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ask: Who else is needed to achieve the value proposition? Who are key partners to fulfill the business promise?
      </p>

      <h4>Cost Structures</h4>
      <p>
        Cost Structures encompass the monetary cost of operating the business.
      </p>
      <p>
